# Managing Custom Event Fields

## Field Types
Fields can represent a few different data types:
* Text - a generally short amount of text, usually fewer than 256 characters
* Fulltext - longer form text, usually represented with a textbox
* Binary - generally reserved for audio or video, manifests as a file select
* Enum - a type with only predefined values.  An example is Age Range with only "Any", "5-18", "18+" as available options

## Settings
### Available for User-Submitted
Selecting this option makes the field visible for users submitting events

### Required for User-Submitted
This makes the field *mandatory* for user submitted events.  By selecting this, submitting an event will require that this field be set.
