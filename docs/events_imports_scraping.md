# Scraping With The Chrome Extension

## Getting the Extension

## Getting a site key
While you can use the extension to produce manifests without a site key, having one (or more) allows you to save and update scrapes directly from the extension itself.  Without this functionality, manifests can be copied and pasted directly into your Pointslocal admin.

To generate or retrieve your key, log into your Pointslocal admin and click *Profile*, which is under your username in the primary nav.  From there, you'll find a section labelled Scraper Extension Key.  Under this you'll find an existing key or the option to generate.

## Adding the site key to the extension
Now that you have a site key, open the Chrome extension by clicking on its P icon

If this is the first time you've used the extension, you'll be prompted to add a key.  If you've used it before and are adding additional keys, click on Add Site and enter the key.
